The security of your personal information is important to us. However, no method
of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 2. Links To External Sites

Our service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If
you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's
site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
of every site you visit.

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy
policies, or practices of any third-party sites, products, or services.

## 3. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

One Space Away Interiors, LLC discloses potentially personally-identifying
information only to those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations
that:

- **(i)** Need to know that information in order to process it on One Space Away
  Interiors, LLC's behalf or to provide services available on our website.

Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be
located outside of your home country; by using our website, you consent to the
transfer of such information to them. One Space Away Interiors, LLC will not
rent or sell potentially personally-identifying information to anyone. Other
than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described

personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order,
or other governmental request, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure
is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of One Space Away
Interiors, LLC, third parties, or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of
[one-space-away-html.pages.dev](https://one-space-away-html.pages.dev/) and have
supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you
about new features, solicit your feedback, or keep you updated on what's going
on with One Space Away Interiors, LLC and our products. We primarily use our
blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect these emails to be
minimal. If you send us a request (for example, via a support email or through
one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it to help
clarify or respond to your request or to support other users.

One Space Away Interiors, LLC takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially
personally-identifying information.
